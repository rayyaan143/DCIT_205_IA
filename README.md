Carry out the following command: git clone https://github.com/rayyaan143/DCIT_205_IA


4)Open the clone folder in an IDE



5)Work  the files in the IDE



6)Open with the live server to view current changes



# IMPACT FROM THE PROJECT


I learned a lot about web development and project management while working on the website for the University of Ghana's Computer Science Department. The project helped me understand the complexities of creating a functional and user-friendly website. 

Working on the Readme file taught me the value of clear and concise documentation in enabling seamless collaboration among team members. It emphasized the importance of providing detailed instructions for future developers in order to ensure the project's long-term viability and ease of maintenance. In addition, I gained a better understanding of version control systems, which improved my ability to track changes and effectively manage collaborative coding efforts.

Furthermore, the project taught me about the ever-changing nature of web technologies and the need for constant adaptation to industry standards.This experience not only improved my technical skills, but also emphasized the importance of flexibility and adaptability in the ever-changing field of computer science. Overall, my participation in the University of Ghana Computer Science Department's website project was a rich learning experience, providing me with practical skills and insights that go beyond the realm of web development.
